🌍 Donation Matching Portal

A web-based platform built during the Code for Change Hackathon 2025 (sponsored by Seva Sahayog Foundation) to streamline and automate in-kind donations between Donors (individuals, corporates, institutions) and Receivers (NGOs, schools, hostels, old-age homes, and community organizations).

The portal ensures transparency, trust, and efficiency in the donation process, reducing manual coordination and accelerating the donation cycle.

✨ Features

✅ Donor Dashboard – Post donations, manage contributions, and view history
✅ Receiver Dashboard – Submit requests, track approval status, and get notifications
✅ Admin Dashboard – Verify, approve, and match donations with requests
✅ Smart Matching – Automatically pair donations with verified requirements
✅ Secure & Scalable – Role-based access control, encrypted data, audit trails
✅ Impactful – Faster donation cycles, less waste, and more transparency
